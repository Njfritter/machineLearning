# Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository!

I will be performing various machine learning algorithms on various datasets (credit and urls will be given) in order to see what we can do with data!
These algorithms will be written in the R and Python languages.

# Some of the machine learning algorithms I will be performing include but are not limited to:

-Simple/Multiple Linear Regression	  	  
-Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis		  
-K Nearest Neighbors	       
-Neural Networks	       
-And more!		       

# If you are here, these concepts are highly recommended you know:

-Regression 
-Explanatory versus Response variables	
-Coefficient values 
-Statistical significance	
-Classes     
-Etc.	     

# We will be using these tools as well:

-R Studio 
-Python	  
-Terminal 
-Various packages associated with R/Python	

# Enjoy and feel free to leave messages/comments. I am a student in college trying to gain machine learning experience on my own, so I am always looking for feedback!
